## Lectures
### Lecture 1

* You can go through all exercises of Section 1 except 1.4.
### Main references
* Most of the course will be based on Murphy's ``Machine Learning" [[Mur12]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiQ6NDzhuXsAhVPLBoKHRQ3AvUQFjAAegQIBxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoc.lagout.org%2Fscience%2FArtificial%2520Intelligence%2FMachine%2520learning%2FMachine%2520Learning_%2520A%2520Probabilistic%2520Perspective%2520%255BMurphy%25202012-08-24%255D.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3X0sY_qZRP7o5WDlWa5X8V).
* If you need exercises on Bayesian derivations, check out ``The Bayesian Core" [[MaRo07]](https://books.google.fr/books/about/Bayesian_Core_A_Practical_Approach_to_Co.html?id=5xwuouehKQoC&redir_esc=y) by Marin and Robert, 2007. The solutions to the exercises are [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.4696.pdf).

* On MCMC, you can check [(Robert, 2004)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387212395) for a thorough reference, or Murphy's book for a quicker survey.
