## Homework and reading material
### Lecture 1
* Annotated slides are [here](https://nextcloud.univ-lille.fr/index.php/s/qy5dB2CY4d52mnr).
* The main reference that I used for this lecture is Chapters 7 and 8 of [(Parmigiani and Inoue, 2009)](https://www.webdepot.umontreal.ca/Usagers/perronf/MonDepotPublic/stt2100/Decision_theory.pdf).
* You can also check Chapter 5 of [(Murphy, 2012)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiQ6NDzhuXsAhVPLBoKHRQ3AvUQFjAAegQIBxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoc.lagout.org%2Fscience%2FArtificial%2520Intelligence%2FMachine%2520learning%2FMachine%2520Learning_%2520A%2520Probabilistic%2520Perspective%2520%255BMurphy%25202012-08-24%255D.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3X0sY_qZRP7o5WDlWa5X8V).
* Exercises to be emailed to me before October 10: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 in Murphy's ML book. Please put [M2DS] as a prefix to your email's object, and your full name in the object. 

### Lecture 2
* Annotated slides are [here](https://nextcloud.univ-lille.fr/index.php/s/gqkAoGN52bngmDY) and [here](https://nextcloud.univ-lille.fr/index.php/s/LcApZoQ6J4EgBbP).
* References are the same as last lecture.
* Exercises to be emailed before next lecture: 4.12, 5.9, and 10.2 in Murphy's book. Please put [M2DS] as a prefix to your email's object, and your full name in the object. I also recommend typing your solutions in LaTeX, and sending me a pdf instead of handwritten notes; LaTeX skills are useful skills.
