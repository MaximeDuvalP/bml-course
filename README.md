# Bayesian machine Learning
Lecturer: RÃ©mi Bardenet

## Evaluation
Two grades: one practical and one project around a research paper.

## Lectures
### Lecture 1
* Chapter 5 of [Mur12], selected exercises.
* HW: finish Exercices of Chapter 5. Read Chapter 23 (IS).
### Lecture 2
* Chapter 23 (IS) of [Mur12], practical on linear regression.
* HW: Do Exercises 23.1 and 23.2 of [Mur12].
* HW: Do Exercises 2.6, 2.9, 2.10, 2.13, 2.14, and 2.15 of [MaRo07].
### Lecture 3
* Chapter 24 (the Gibbs sampler, until Section 24.2.3)
* HW: rederive Section 24.2.3, including the corresponding graphical model (for a quick reminder on graphical models, read Chapter 10 until 10.2.1 included).
* HW: Exercise 6.3 in [MaRo07].
* HW: finish the first practical. I will post a solution on Friday if you need help.
